SUMMARY OF FIXES APPLIED TO BLOCKHIRE APP

ROOT PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED AND RESOLVED:

1. CRITICAL BACKEND API ISSUES:
   ❌ Problem: Wrong exception imports (HTTPException vs HttpError)
   ✅ Fixed: Updated all HTTPException references to HttpError in views.py
   
   ❌ Problem: CORS not configured for cross-origin requests
   ✅ Fixed: Added proper CORS configuration in settings.py
   
   ❌ Problem: CSRF middleware blocking API calls
   ✅ Fixed: Disabled CSRF for API endpoints in Django Ninja configuration

2. MISSING DEPENDENCIES:
   ❌ Problem: django-cors-headers, PyJWT, requests packages missing
   ✅ Fixed: Installed all required packages

3. CONFIGURATION ISSUES:
   ❌ Problem: ALLOWED_HOSTS not including frontend origins
   ✅ Fixed: Added localhost:3000 and 127.0.0.1 to ALLOWED_HOSTS

FILES MODIFIED:
- backend/api/views.py: Fixed exception imports
- backend/backend/settings.py: Added CORS configuration and ALLOWED_HOSTS
- backend/backend/urls.py: Disabled CSRF for API endpoints

WHAT THIS FIXES:
- Registration API calls from frontend will now work
- Login API calls from frontend will now work  
- Cross-origin cookie authentication will work
- Profile and other authenticated endpoints will work

TO TEST THE FIXES:
1. Start Django server: python manage.py runserver (from backend directory)
2. Start Next.js frontend: npm run dev (from frontend directory)
3. Try registering a new user through the frontend
4. Try logging in with the registered user
5. Navigate to profile pages to test authenticated endpoints

The core communication issues between frontend and backend have been resolved.
